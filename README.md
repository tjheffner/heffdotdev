Tanner Heffner's personal website

This site is based on swyxkit, a lightly opinionated starter for Svelte projects:

- SvelteKit + Netlify adapter!
- Tailwind 3 + Tailwind Typography (with [swyx fixes](https://youtu.be/-FzemNMcOGs))
- [JSDoc Typechecking](https://swyxkit.netlify.app/how-to-add-jsdoc-typechecking-to-sveltekit)
- [GitHub Issues as CMS](https://github.com/sw-yx/swyxkit/issues/10)

## Setup

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

## Acknowledgements

# About

This is my personal site, built using swyxkit.

It is a place for me to share my work as well as dump longer form writing than is appropriate for twitter.
Some posts will be technical in nature but I envision posting recipes and gardening updates here as well.
I'm sure it will evolve over time, but this is only the beginning. Thanks for visiting! :)

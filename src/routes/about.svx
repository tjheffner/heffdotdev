# About

this site is the online home of tanner heffner. it's part portfolio, part playground and all [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), using [swyxkit]() as my starting point.

i intend to have information about past projects, as well as a place to post technical snippets, cooking recipes, reviews and longer writing that isn't appropriate for twitter. lord knows i've tweeted enough already.

maybe some things you find here will be useful or interesting to you, maybe they won't. this website is for me.
